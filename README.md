## To run locally

The project needs Jekyll and other dependencies to run locally. These can be installed with Bundler by running the following commands.

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
Run Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --force_polling --baseurl ''
```

Open it up in your browser: <http://localhost:4000/>
