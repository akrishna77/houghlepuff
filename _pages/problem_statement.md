The field of Computer Vision has seen many advances over the last few years, but we haven't been able to achieve the same standards as human perception. In this project, we focus on the specific task of visual relationship detection to make progress towards genuine scene understanding. Our goal is to be able to detect objects of interest in an image, given a particular relationship that has been highlighted through text input. The input to the system is an image along with a textual description of an object-object relationship and the output is the image with bounding boxes around the objects that correspond to the textual input. Given the input, plate next to pizza‚Äù, the output would be the pink bounding box on the right:
